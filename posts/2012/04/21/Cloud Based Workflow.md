I have been thinking a lot about cloud based workflow management.

I keep watching all these conference videos and reading blogs about how cool Github is, as they have this amazing workflow going. Well why not give that to everyone ?


Build a service that hosts a configurable chat bot , integration with Github / CodePlex / BitBucket, integration with the major application hosts like Heroku and even Rackspace and Amazon EC2, easy to use chat interface for the office, a build server and anything else a we can throw at it ...

Sort of a Glue between all the services for companies.

Then think about it.

* From John - Quickly perform that Deploy! We need to get this fix out!<br />
* -&gt; somebotname deploy somoesitename<br />
* Retrieving Fresh Codebase from Github<br />
* Running Tests ....<br />
* 5 out of 5 passed - 100%<br />
* Deploying to 5 Servers using Torrents / FTP ....<br />
* Site Deployed in 5.124214s<br />
* (To Everyone) John Deployed somesitename. Build passed view at - somesitename<br />
* -&gt; somebotname scale rackspace 2 size=512mb<br />
* Creating 2 Rackspace Server with 512mb ram.<br />

Going to be building this.

No idea when or if it will be done but that's what I want for my development!
