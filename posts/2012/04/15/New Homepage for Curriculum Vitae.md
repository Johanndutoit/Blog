Had a look at the current homepage for the site and there is too much TEXT.

Here's the current homepage:

<img src="/img/posts/curriculumvitae/homepage-before-update-15-04-2012.png" alt="Old homepage of Curriculum Vitae" />

No-one wants to read all that, users just want to manage and make CV's. Users want to get on the site and know what they site was built for and not read all the information about the site on the damn homepage.

So did a update to the homepage. Wanted to show the goal of the site without too much reading involved. So the new homepage after the update looks like this:

<img src="/img/posts/curriculumvitae/homepage-after-update-15-04-2012.png" alt="New homepage of Curriculum Vitae" />

What do you think ?
