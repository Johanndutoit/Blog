The site - <a href="http://www.curriculumvitae.co.za/" target="_blank">Curriculum Vitae</a>&nbsp;- is currently very tightly build. Which is very bad. All data and functions - except for the Mail Server - are in the main application, which was fine while I was developing it but recently I have been wanting to expand it with new features but they require a bit of a rewrite of some of the functions.

<ol>
<li>First Feature I would like to implement would be to allow users to generate a CV without logging in. Only asking for a Login if they want to save their information. This enables me to generate CV's for even the paranoid.</li>
<li>Second Feature would be sections for your CV. Which you would be able to move, edit, add and remove. This will give the builder quite a bit of&nbsp;strength.</li>
<li>Third feature would be custom templates for Recruiters. Every Recruiter wants to only see information in their format and how they expect it.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

Got some work ahead of me, so let's do this.
