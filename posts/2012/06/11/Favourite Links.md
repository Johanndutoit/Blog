Was recently talking to a good friend of mine. And our conversation changed towards interesting arcticles I'v been reading online. I follow a slew of technical blogs that I have collected along the years. This means I get great news, daily. Which I think everyone should be able to read.

So I present

> Interesting Links of the week

I'm going to be posting links that I've read the day and found interesting. This will allow anyone following my blog. To have a aggregated list of links that I quite liked, and think they would like.

But what if I don't find anything interesting enough for that day? Well then I will not post anything. This is purely to give others a some interesting links not to drown you in articles.

These lists will include, links to blog post, tutorials, articles, podcasts and maybe some of my personal sites and or work. Anything that will keep you busy reading / learning about great things online.

So something for everybody.
