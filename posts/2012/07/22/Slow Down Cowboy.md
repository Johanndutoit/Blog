Was browsing Stackoverflow recently, as I and most programmers I know do.

And saw a question come up about how Stackoverflow site knows when a vote is processed, a comment added or a new answer posted. As the OP checked firebug but the site does not post any AJAX requests.

And I saw the usual barrage of Programmers going:

	WHO IS THIS IDIOT, YOU DON'T KNOW AJAX!?!?! DOWN VOTE TO HELL.

One Comment was:

	Of course it's AJAX!

And saw the down votes coming in. But then while this was happening I decided to check what Stackoverflow was really using. And turns out the OP won't see any AJAX calls as SO is using Web Sockets. So they were right to ask but the cowboys of the SO arena, don't care.

This could have been a great chance to teach some beginner or even someone that just hasn't heard of Web Sockets about the new Standard. But it's gone now!

Not all newbie just ask without experimenting first, as it seems most SO users think. See that the OP tried firebug ? They actually tried looking at the traffic and how SO does what it does!

### The OP ended up removing the Question, seconds later to avoid the hail storm of big ego programmers.

Rage done, back to Stackoverflow....
