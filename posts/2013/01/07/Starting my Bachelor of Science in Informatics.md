I finally took the plunge and started with my degree this year.

I'm taking the <a href="http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/index.asp?link=http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/Navigation/CSET_ALL.html">Bachelor of Science in Informatics</a> course for a few reasons:

* Had a look at the Topics they cover and this will give me a real deep understanding of some of the fundamentals I work with every day.
* It had none of the advance math from CompSci. Which few years after leaving school all looks like Greek to me !

I'll be providing updates on the experience with Unisa through the course of the degree and give everyone some insight on how Unisa works.

## Application

The very first thing we had to do was to Apply. When you apply it's just a simple process of checking if you actually qualify for the course. You'll hear back in a few weeks.

I submitted my ID Document and National Certificate, certified by the police.

Once Unisa gets back to you, you'll either get the green light or they will guide you to a route that will allow you to achieve what you first applied for.

## Registering

After the application period is closed. The registration period starts. This is where you will be able to register for the modules you which to take in either the first or second semester and you will need to start paying for the modules.

This is all quite easy thanks to their self-service site.

## Study Material

After a few weeks you'll get a notice from Unisa and they will send all the required study material for the semester.

This includes the books (only for modules where they provide the books) and tutorials. The tutorials act much like your teacher and give you information on all the assignments, prescribed books and due dates.

## And that's it. Now it's just to study and get it ready for the assignments and exam ! Wish me luck !

Also plan on giving a review on each book once I'm gone through them.
